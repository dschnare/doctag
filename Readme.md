# Overview

Doctag exposes several Go packages that handle reading doctag files.

## What's a doctag?

Doctags are simple tags that can be written in any text document used to indicate
a named or tagged piece of content. An example document with a doctag could be:

  	<{headline}>
  	Today's News Stories

When this document is parsed it would parse out a DoctagNode with the name "headline" and
value "\nToday's News Stories". The parsing functions makes the assumption that leading
and trailing whitespace characters are important. It's left for the consumer of the parse
results to decide how to treat leading/trailing whtiespace.

Doctag names can contain any unicode character so long as the tag suffix substring is not encountered.
This example treats doctags like a file system hierarchy. Also notice that doctag names can contain
leading and trailing whitespace characters for greater ledgability.

  	<{ page/title }>
  	Today's News Stories

  	<{ page/content }>
  	Blah ablah blab ablaha bal.

Sometimes you may want to skip or ignore a doctag. This can be achieved by prefixing a doctag
with the '!' character.

  	<{ !page/title }>
  	Yesterday's News Stories

  	<{ page/title }>
  	Today's News Stories

You may also use this to facilitate a open/close pattern to your doctags, thereby giving more control
over leading and trailing whitespace and/or improving ledgability.

  	<{ page/title }>Today's News Stories<{!}>

  	<{ page/content }>
  	Blah ablah blab ablaha bal.
  	<{!}>


# Packages

**[parse](parse/Readme.txt)** - Package parse builds a slice of nodes from UTF-8 encoded text documents that have doctags.

**[identifier](identifier/Readme.txt)** - Package identifier implements a converter for UTF-8 strings to UTF-8 identifiers.

**[hierarchy](hierarchy/Readme.txt)** - Package hierarchy implements a doctag transformer that transforms a list of doctags into a map hierarchy.

**[main](doctag.txt)** - Package main implements a command line utility that exposes a doctag parser and hierarchy transformer.
